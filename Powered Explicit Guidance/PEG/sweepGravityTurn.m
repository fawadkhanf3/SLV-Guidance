%sweepGravityTurn.m
%Performs a natural gravity turn (with prograde lock) simulation for a
%given set of parameters (initial velocities and pitch angles). 'Sweeps' a
%2-D parameter space generating a result vector for each point (apoapsis
%altitude and maxQ value).
%Dependencies:
%   flightSim2D.m       legacy 2D simulation, because faster than 3D
%                       consider complete migration to 3D for consistency
