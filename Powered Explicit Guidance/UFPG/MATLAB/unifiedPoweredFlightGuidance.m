    %We need to store dt in order to keep track on maneuver time.
    dt = t-tp;
    %In the paper, this block assumes the only known thing about vehicle's
    %state change since the last iteration is vector of velocity change
    %(delta-v_sensed) and time interval (delta t). In this implementation
    %however we assume the state is perfectly known and hence the call to
    %Powered Flight Navigation Routine is not necessary.
    %However, we still decrement vgo here!
    dvsensed = v - vprev;
    vgo = vgo - dvsensed; vgo1 = vgo;
    %Calculation of 'remaining time to burn in stage k' (which here means
    %current stage) is done differently than in the paper. There, t_b,k is
    %decremented by dt every iteration; here this variable is not
    %persistent, but re-read from vehicle data at each iteration, and
    %instead we remember the current burn time tb, so we simply subtract
    %this time from original time-to-burn, obtaining the remaining time.
    tb(1) = tb(1) - previous.tb;
    
    %BLOCK 3
    %Current vehicle parameters have already been obtained in block 1, the
    %only thing different is a_T,k which should be calculated from current
    %mass instead of initial, and subsequently tu,k.
    %This is done according to theory on pages 33-34 and block diagrams on
    %56-57, although with a small change: original document for the Space
    %Shuttle assumed that standard ascent will be finalized with a
    %predetermined OMS burn (Orbiter's SSMEs burning fuel from ET will only
    %take it so far, then the ET is jettisoned and vehicle coasts for a
    %predetermined amount of time (tc), after which the last burn phase
    %circularizes). Therefore, active guidance did not calculate the
    %integral Li(n). Stages 1..n-2 were assumed to burn out completely
    %(hence the logarithmic expression for them), and stage n-1 has burn
    %time set accordingly, so the total delta-v expended equals vgo.
    %In this application however, there is no such thing as a predetermined
    %final stage velocity. Therefore, stages n-1 are assumed to burn out
    %completely, and the last one is adjusted, so it burns out only as long
    %as needed.
